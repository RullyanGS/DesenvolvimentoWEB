    <h1>Exemplo de paragraph</h1>
    <p>Greg understood that this situation would make Michael terribly 
    uncomfortable. Michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even 
    though Greg could prevent it from happening, he opted to let it happen. 
    It was quite ironic, really. It was something Greg had said he would never 
    wish upon anyone a million times, yet here he was knowingly letting it 
    happen to one of his best friends. He rationalized that it would ultimately 
    make Michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable, everyone 
    should experience racism at least once in their lifetime.</p><br />
